## Abstract:
Urban areas are continuously changing with time in demographic and economic development context. Water resources manager needs planning and management tools to come up with decisions for managing water resources to meet demand of present as well as future. Logan city in Cache County, Utah is facing high population growth rate which exceeds the population projection. To meet increasing water demand, modelling of available water resources is required to determine the system ability to meet those demand. The aim of the project is to model municipal water demand of Logan city meanwhile facing competition from other stakeholders. To do this, performance metrics were developed, structural and non-structural management alternatives were proposed then these alternatives were evaluated in WEAP. Based on the results, it is recommended to build a new reservoir to meet the increasing water demand in Logan city.
