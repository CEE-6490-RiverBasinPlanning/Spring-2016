## Abstract:
The supply of water is imperative when addressing wetland issues because water is the dominant factor determining the nature of soil development and the types of plant and animal communities living in the soil and on its surface (US DOI, 2004), which directly affects the habitat of priority bird species. For this reason, the primary objective of the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge (BRMBR) relates to the management and manipulation of target water levels for wetland units. However, a review of the historical flows to the BRMBR indicates that the quantity of flow during summer months (i.e. July, August, September) are on average below the delivery targets. During these periods, the BRMBR resorts to an adaptive management strategy, prioritizing bird species and focusing efforts (water diversions) to maintain the respective wetland habitats of these species. In order to improve the success of all habitats, which improves overall bird species occupation in the BRMBR, water management strategies must be developed to better secure water deliveries during these months. For this reason, this report investigates three management alternatives designed specifically to improve summer water deliveries to the BRMBR so that unmet water demands can be significantly reduced or eliminated all together. In addition, this report looks at how implementing these alternatives affect the water supplied to the Bear River Canal Company, PacifiCorp, and the City of Logan, UT. The modeling of the alternatives was conducted in the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model for the Lower Bear River system. The success of each alternative was evaluated based on defined performance metrics where the primary criteria for success was monthly water deliveries to the BRMBR but also on the seasonality of habitat use by priority bird species. Analysis of the alternatives with respect to the performance metrics of the BRMBR and affects to the aforementioned stakeholders reveals that the construction of a new reservoir on the Bear River above Cutler Reservoir is the best alternative for increasing flows to the BRMBR. In addition, this alternative is also favorable to the three other stakeholders, making it an all around beneficial option.
