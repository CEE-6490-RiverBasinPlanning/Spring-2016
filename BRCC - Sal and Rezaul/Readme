The Group Project Final Report on Performance Evaluation of Bear River Canal Company (Project_Report_Performance_Evaluation_BRCC_CEE6490_USU.pdf) is uploaded in this folder. It also contains the complete WEAP zip file (LowerBearRiver-Spring2016-BRCC_Data_Complete_05032016.zip). Additionally six MS Excel files have been uploaded. These files include input data, calculation and results.
Abstract: Water demand is higher in the months of May to September (irrigation season) compared to the rest of the months in Box Elder County. From October to April, water is diverted mostly for animal live stocks and for some incidental irrigation. Currently BRCC is facing shortage of irrigation water in the months of July to September which is responsible for reduced crop yield in Box Elder County, Utah, USA. Most of the crop grows actively in the months of May to September. Shortage of irrigation water in active growth stage can have detrimental impact on the crop yield. This report develops alternative management scenarios (including structural and non-structural measures) to reduce the amount of irrigation water shortage and thereby improve the performance of BRCC. CropWat (8.0) has been used to calculate field irrigation requirement (FIR) and Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model has been developed for the Bear River watershed to simulate water deliveries under historical flow conditions and different scenarios. Structural alternative made maximum improvement of the performance of stakeholders compared to non-structural options.
Note: One needs to run the model (zip file) and find results for different scenarios.
It is also to be noted that one needs to extract the unmet demands for different scenarios for BRCC, Bird Refuge, and Logan City stakeholders and copy them into the  attached MS Excel sheet for calculaion. Average monthly hydropower generation for PacifiCorp stakeholder should be extracted which has been used as performance metrics for this stakeholder.
