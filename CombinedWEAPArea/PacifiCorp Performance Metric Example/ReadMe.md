###Changes to Model

Addition of three reservoirs to lower-bear river have been included: Soda, Grace, and Oneida.  Each reservoir will have a Storage Capacity, Volume Elevation Curve, Net Evaporation, a delivery Priority, Max. Turbine Flow, Tailwater Elevation, Plant Efficiency, and Energy Demand.

###Definitions of Performance Criteria

Hydropower Generation:  Megawatts (MW). The amount of electrical energy produced by the dam when water is released. The objective is to maximize this value.

Unmet Water Demand:  Acre-foot (ac-ft). The amount of water delivered to demand sites of the entire system. The objective is to minimize this value.

These metrics will be tested using the following methods: 1) changes in reservoir operation and release policy, 2) chaining the priority of energy production demand with respect to water delivery demand.

###How to Calculate Performance Metrics:

Hydropower Generation. [Screen Shot here!](https://github.com/CEE-6490-RiverBasinPlanning/Spring-2016/blob/master/CombinedWEAPArea/PacifiCorp%20Performance%20Metric%20Example/Hydropower%20Generation%20Ex.PNG)

1.	Go to the Results page in your WEAP model.
2.	In the first drop down box, go to “Supply and Resources” > “Reservoir” > “Hydropower Generation”.
3.	For the x-axis select “All Years” from the drop down list.
4.	For the y-axis select “Selected Reservoirs” from the drop down list.   From the list, click on the check box for the “Soda, Grace, and Oneida” reservoirs.  Then click the “OK” button.
5.	In the legend, select which scenarios you would like to view (in our image example we show alternative solutions for 1) Best Hydropower Generation, 2) Best for Unmet Water Demand, 3) Mid-Range Results, 4) The Reference scenario, where no reservoir operations have been selected.
6.	For units, select “Megawatt.”
7.	Select “All months (12).”
8.	For simplicity, click on the “Monthly Average” check box.

1.	Go to the Results page in your WEAP model.
2.	In the first drop down box, go to “Demand” > “Unmet Demand.”
3.	For the x-axis select “All Years” from the drop down list.
4.	For the y-axis select “All Demand Sites” from the drop down list (or choose a specific demand site.
5.	In the legend, select which scenarios you would like to view (in our image example we show alternative solutions for 1) Best Hydropower Generation, 2) Best for Unmet Water Demand, 3) Mid-Range Results, 4) The Reference scenario, where no reservoir operations have been selected.
6.	For units, select “Acre-foot.”
7.	Select “All months (12).”
