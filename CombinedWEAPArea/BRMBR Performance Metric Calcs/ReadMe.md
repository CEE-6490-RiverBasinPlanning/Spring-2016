## How to calculate performance metrics for the BRMBR:
1. **Download** the performance calculation workbook for the BRMBR ([BRMBR_workbook.xlsx](https://github.com/CEE-6490-RiverBasinPlanning/Spring-2016/blob/master/CombinedWEAPArea/BRMBR%20Performance%20Metric%20Calcs/BRMBR_workbook.xlsx)). This can also be found in the BRMBR folder. Click **View Raw** to download the file. 
2. Go to the Results page in your **WEAP model**.
  1. Select the 'chart' tab in the top right.
  2. Select the 'Damand', then **'Unmet Demand'** in the first drop down. 
  3. On the right most drop down select **'All Scenarios'**.
  4. On the bottom drop down select **'All Years'**.
  5. On the bottom left drop down select **'Demand Site: Bird Refuge'**.
  6. Units should be in **'Thousand' 'Acre-foot'** and **'All months (12)'** and **'No comparison'** should be chosen. 
  7. Click the excel icon on the right most column of options. Hovering over the icon it will say **'Export Table to Excel'**.
