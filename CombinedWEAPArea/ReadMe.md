**Stakeholder**: BRCC

Stakeholder: Bear River Canal Company (BRCC).
Definitions of Performance Criteria:
Reliability, Resilience, and Vulnerability (RRV) metrics measure different aspects of a water resources system performance (Hashimoto et al., 1982). RRV metrics provide one of the most comprehensive approaches for analyzing the probability of success or failure of a system, the rate of recovery of a system from unsatisfactory states, as well as quantifying the expected consequence of being in unsatisfactory states for extended periods (Asefa et at., 2014).
Reliability: Reliability is the fraction of time the system is in a satisfactory state and is given as:
Reliability=(# of observations that are satisfactory)/(Total # of observations)……………………(1)

Resiliency: Resiliency is the likelihood for the system to recover from an unsatisfactory state and is given as:
Resiliency=(# of transitions from failure in time t to unsatisfactory state in time t+1)/(Total # of failures)……(2)

Vulnerability: Vulnerability is the average difference from the threshold for unsatisfactory states and is given as:
Vulnerability=(∑_(t is at failures)▒〖|P_t-Threshlod|〗)/(Total # of failures)…………(3)
Where, Pt = Value of the parameter when the system is in unsatisfactory state
		Threshold = Threshold value of the parameter in question for identifying the system to be in satisfactory state.

Description of Performance Metric Calculations: The unmet demand of BRCC for the base case scenario from WEAP is exported to an MS excel file. Reliability, resilience, vulnerability of BRCC are calculated according to equations 1 through 3.
